# Moodle for IONOS

Moodle patch for installation on the IONOS hosting. www.ionos.de - the most popular hosting in Germany.  The default Moodle cannot work on IONOS hosting, because the system paths do not match. It needs to be replaced. 

You can download the patch for your version of the muddle and replace the files with you. After that, your Moodle will work on the IONOS  hosting for example as on this project https://evvhs.eu/
